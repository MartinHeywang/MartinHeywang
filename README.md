### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !

I'm Martin Heywang and I have been on GitHub since January 2020 ! I have been learning programming since end 2018 and I still can't imagine how I could stand more than 1 year without GitHub (and Git too).

#### Iâ€™m currently learning the web

The web makes almost everything possible : it is cross-platform, it can be responsive (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). And of course, the community is... awesome.
