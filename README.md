# Profile: Martin Heywang

I'm a french 🇫🇷 teenager, **mid-time student 🏫** and **mid-time self-taught developer 💻**. I've been into programming since September 2018. I like to scratch my head, or more precisely **that feeling you get when you achieve something 😀**.

- I use spaces for indentation,
- I use semicolons everywhere I can (even in javascript),
- I think HTML and CSS **are** programming languages,
- ...

**Whatever. Let's stop beating around the bush.**

## Experience 💻

### Languages

#### Languages I master

The ones I got the most experience on.

- `Java` (2y experience, [1 big project](https://github.com/MartinHeywang/products))
- `TypeScript` (1.5y experience, [1 big project](https://github.com/MartinHeywang/revispace) + [1 medium-sized project](https://github.com/MartinHeywang/origeen))

#### Languages I tried

- `Rust`, felt interesting, but found no use case for it (maybe WebAssembly in the future?),
- `C++`, probably the hardest one I tried.
