# Profile: Martin Heywang

I'm a french 🇫🇷 teenager, **mid-time high-school student 🏫** and **mid-time self-taught developer 💻**. I've been into programming since 2018. I like to scratch my head, or more precisely **that feeling you get when you achieve something 😀**.

## Coding journey 💻

- started coding with Java in September 2018 (+ JavaFX, SQLite, ORMLite, ...)
- worked on my first personal project named PRODUCTS., an assembly-line game (during 1.5 years!)
- learnt web development (JavaScript first, then HTML & CSS)
- added some projects to my library, such as 
  - a web-based calculator, 
  - a vanilla JS todo-app,
  - a web-based minesweeper game, 
  - a web-based slideshow explaining log4j's vulnerability in 2021,
- improved my web skills by learning ReactJS, Typescript, Sass and making even more projects :
  - Révispace, an app for revising high-school courses,
  - a literal calculator : develops, reduces and simplifies mathematical expressions),
  - a website representing common data structures,
- briefly learnt Python (used in math courses) as well as Rust (just because it's faster),
